Let S be set of atoms in space;
Let n be the totol number of atoms in search-space
Initially,
	S={X1,X2,...,Xn}, Xi is an atom with weight W

for-each iteration iter:
	Let n' = |S|
	check fitness-value for each atom in S
	Choose best_atom.
	for-each atom in S:
		if atom != best_atom:
			if atom.weight>1:
				break atom into atom1 and atom2, whose weight is atom.weight/2
				atom1 will move towards best_atom
				atom2 will move in opposite direction, and move for distance that was moved by atom1.
				Mathematically: delta(atom1)=delta(atom2)
			else
				atom will move towards best_atom
		else:
			best_atom will move according to gravitational-force from all the other atoms.
